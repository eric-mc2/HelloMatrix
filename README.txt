This project implements basic matrix and linear algebra operations.
My goal in writing it is to learn C++ and to reinforce the material from an intro to linear algebra course.
A secondary goal is to think about parallelism and to learn MPI.
A non-goal is to beat the standard libraries like BLAS. Of course they will be miles better.

Usage:
This project only defines a test executable to verify the Matrix class. 
To run the tests:
Open a terminal to the project root directory.
$ make test
$ ./test

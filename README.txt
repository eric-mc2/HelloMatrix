This project implements basic matrix and linear algebra operations.
My goal in writing it is to learn C++ and to reinforce the material from an intro to linear algebra course.
A secondary goal is to think about parallelism and to learn MPI.
A non-goal is to beat the standard libraries like BLAS. Of course they will be miles better.
